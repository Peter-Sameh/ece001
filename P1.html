Back in the 1950s, the fathers of the field Minsky and McCarthy, described 
artificial intelligence as any task performed by a program or a machine that, 
if a human carried out the same activity, we would say the human had to apply intelligence to accomplish the task.
That obviously is a fairly broad definition, which is why you will sometimes 
see arguments over whether something is truly AI or not.
AI systems will typically demonstrate at least some of the following behaviours associated 
with human intelligence: planning, learning, reasoning, problem solving, knowledge representation, 
perception, motion, and manipulation and, to a lesser extent, social intelligence and creativity.

From SIRI to self-driving cars, artificial intelligence (AI) is progressing rapidly. While science 
fiction often portrays AI as robots with human-like characteristics, AI can encompass anything from Google’s 
search algorithms to IBM’s Watson to autonomous weapons.
Artificial intelligence today is properly known as narrow AI (or weak AI), in that it is designed to
 perform a narrow task (e.g. only facial recognition or only internet searches or only driving a car). 
 However, the long-term goal of many researchers is to create general AI (AGI or strong AI). 
 While narrow AI may outperform humans at whatever its specific task is, like playing chess or 
 solving equations, AGI would outperform humans at nearly every cognitive task.
