Artificial intelligence is impacting the future of virtually every industry and every human being. Artificial intelligence has acted as the main driver of emerging 
technologies like big data, robotics and IoT, and it will continue to act as a technological innovator for the foreseeable future.<br/ >
<br/ >
The final goal of artificial intelligence (AI)—that a machine can have a type of general intelligence similar to a human’s—is one of 
the most ambitious ever proposed by science. In terms of difficulty, it is comparable to other great scientific goals, such as explaining 
the origin of life or the Universe, or discovering the structure of matter. In recent centuries, this interest in building intelligent 
machines has led to the invention of models or metaphors of the human brain. In the seventeenth century, for example, Descartes wondered 
whether a complex mechanical system of gears, pulleys, and tubes could possibly emulate thought. Two centuries later, the metaphor had become 
telephone systems, as it seemed possible that their connections could be likened to a neural network. Today, the dominant model is 
computational and is based on the digital computer. Therefore, that is the model we will address in the present article.
